# CHAPTER_2
Creating a Hello World App

The Chapter 2 serves as a practical introduction to Flutter development by guiding readers through the creation of their first applicationâ€”a simple "Hello World" app. This chapter is designed to familiarize beginners with the Flutter development environment and the basic workflow of creating, running, and modifying a Flutter project. Readers are introduced to the fundamental structure of a Flutter app, learning how its components fit together to produce a functional application.

This chapter provides clear instructions for running the app on both the iOS simulator and the Android emulator, ensuring developers are comfortable working across platforms. Additionally, it demonstrates how to make simple changes to the code and observe their impact, introducing the iterative and reactive nature of Flutter development. Importantly, readers are encouraged not to worry about fully understanding the code at this stage, as the chapter focuses on practical experience and building confidence. Detailed explanations of the underlying concepts and functionality will be provided in later chapters, allowing readers to gradually deepen their knowledge while building a solid foundation.
